This is an image to depth tool. It uses models found on the hugging face hub and converts images to a depth array. 
It then exports a black and white image along with an obj file that represents the depth map. There are some functions 
inside that allow you to define the camera intrinsics but I turned them off because the main use of this tool was to 
get a thin bas-relief image that could be 3d printed or milled, and ignoring the camera intrinsics is beneficial to 
our process.
