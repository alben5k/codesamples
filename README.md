# codesamples
You can find samples of my work in the folders above. 

The folders are organized by focus and what skill I was trying to demonstrate.

Here is a brief overview of the folders:
- Math Stuff: This folder contains code that demonstrates my ability to write mathematical algorithms and use mathematical libraries.
- OOP and Abstractions: This folder contains code that demonstrates my ability to write object-oriented code and use abstractions to build modular systems.

Along with code snippets, here is a breakdown of some projects I have worked on in the past at my previous jobs:

1. A Digital Content Creation (DCC) software agnostic asset management system.
2. A database agnostic data system using dataclasses.
3. A system for interprocess communication between a DCC software and a game engine.
4. A system to import/export a game asset into a DCC software and back to the game engine.
    1. A system to do a similar process with a proprietary animation DCC software and Maya. 
5. A full suite of rigging tools for Maya using Python and PyMel.
6. Several User Interface (UI) tools for all of my tools using Python and PyQt and Pyside2.
7. A tool to communicate with artists up and downstream with production tracking, inside of the DCC software.
    1. This tool was built using Qt and PySide2.
    2. This tool was used as the main form of communication between the artists up and downstream.
8. A system to manage the data of a game and the data of a DCC software and keep them in sync.
9. A fully featured package manager for a visual effects pipeline.
